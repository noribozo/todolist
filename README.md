One of my first React projects from the beginning to publishing.
I'm very proud of it, although I designed it with the help of a tutorial video. 
It is a milestone in my learning process.
I wanted to understand how to start building a react app from zero and show it to everyone when finished.
It took me a lot of time and effort and retry but finally here it is.
